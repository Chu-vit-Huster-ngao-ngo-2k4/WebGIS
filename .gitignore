# !data/buildings.geojson <- Too large (1GB), must ignore

# Keep sample data if needed, but ignore massive ones. 
# Assuming buildings.geojson is the sample one used in the app, we keep it. 
# But usually geojson can be big. I'll ignore general large extensions but maybe exception for small config files.
# Let's just block the known large binary formats for now.

# Generated Tiles / Test Images
*.mvt
# *.png logic: Only ignore if they are tiles. If we have assets, we shouldn't.
# Given the project state, safe to maybe exclude test_raster.png from version control if it's a test artifact.
